This is a React-based web application designed to fetch and display user details dynamically. It includes a dark/light theme toggle and profile management with conditional rendering. To run the project locally, clone the repository using `git clone <repository-url>` and navigate into the project folder. Then, install the required dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`. Start the dev server with the command `npm start` or `yarn start`, then go to the app in your browser with the address at `http://localhost:3000`. This application fetches the user information from an API hosted outside its server (`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/:id`). 

It selects random profile pictures from a specified list. It supports a theme toggle that has been implemented using `styled-components` and React Context with dynamic styling for both dark and light themes. There is also conditional rendering to ensure a seamless user experience and loading when data is being fetched, with an empty state "No User Found" message if the filtered data is empty. For individual user information display, it uses the `Userdetails` component, while the `LoaderContainer` handles the empty states.

The app uses features of navigation, including `react-router-dom` and a "Back" button for the ease of the user. The responsive layout is built using `styled-components` to render well on desktop and mobile devices. It also catches API errors by showing an amicable error message in case the API request fails. Overall, this project offers a clean, reusable, and dynamic framework for managing and displaying data about users in an effective way.
